# DSA-Journey

Welcome to **DSA-Journey**! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. The primary goal of this project is to practice and refine my problem-solving skills, particularly in C++.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the A2Z DSA Course/Sheet by Striver, such as:

- **Step 1: Learn the basics**
- **Step 2: Learn Important Sorting Techniques**
- **Step 3: Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy -> Medium -> Hard]**
- **Step 4: Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]**
- **Step 5: Strings [Basic and Medium]**
- **etc.**

Each folder contains files for specific problems, where you will find:

- Problem description
- C++ code implementation
- **Detailed comments explaining key parts of the solution and the reasoning behind them, aimed at both understanding the solution and serving as a reference for future revision.**

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-Journey.git
